- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mattsmerg
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and scripting as a hobby, and hopefully one day being able to apply it to my career
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and while Python itself seems perfectly sensible, my coworker told me I should get to understand pip and pandas along with it, and MAN, I am stumped. Ah, well. Nest way to learn is to keep hammerin' away, right?
